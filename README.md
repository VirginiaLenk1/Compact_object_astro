Here is a collection of the exercise sheets for the lecture: 'Compact Object Astrophysics' Wintersemester 2024. 
The exercise sheets are usually structured with an introduction/tutorial and at the end the exercises/solutions. 
All solutions are written by me, therefore these are not official solutions.
No guarantee that everything is correct.
